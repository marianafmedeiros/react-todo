# Todo app with React.js

## About

This is a simple web app made with react to build up my skills using this framework.

I implemented the basic CRUD features, so you can create, update and delete tasks. I also used local storage to fetch and read the tasks that were already created in order to have a persistent list as I did not use any database.

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Sweet and simple :)
